== Short Bio 

I am a third year PhD candidate affiliated with the [https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/ipg/ Information Processing Group (IPG)] in the [https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/ School of Computer and Communication Sciences] at the [https://www.epfl.ch/ Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)], Switzerland. I am fortunate to be advised by [https://people.epfl.ch/yanina.shkel/?lang=en Yanina Shkel] and [https://people.epfl.ch/michael.gastpar/?lang=en Michael Gastpar]. My research interests broadly lie in the union of theoretical computer science, privacy, and communications. Beyond my research endeavors, I spend time exploring the flora and fauna around me, learning languages, and reading articles on Psychology and International Relations. \n

I spent the summers of 2024 at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs Bell Labs] where I worked with [https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=AT7ZiYYAAAAJ&hl=de Christoph Fuellner] and [https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=f-B6HMwAAAAJ&hl=en Rene Bonk] on building robust access Passive Optical Networks (PONs).\n

Previously, I completed my bachelors with a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the [https://www.iitp.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IIT-P)] in India. I have been fortunate to have worked with [https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi Sidharth Jaggi] (University of Bristol), [http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/ Amitalok Budkuley] (IIT Kharagpur), [https://sites.google.com/view/yihan/ Yihan Zhang] (IST Austria), [https://perso-etis.ensea.fr/luzzi/ Laura Luzzi] (ENSEA, CNRS), and [https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/en-us/people-2/faculty/2-uncategorised/194-view-profile-8 Preetam Kumar] (IIT Patna) on different projects during my undergraduate. My bachelors thesis titled 'Secure two-party computation: Information-theoretic Oblivious Transfer', received the Institute Proficiency award for the best thesis in my cohort. \n
